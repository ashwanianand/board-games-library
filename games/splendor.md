## Overview

Splendor is an elegant resource-management and engine-building game set in the Renaissance gem trade. Players collect gem tokens to purchase development cards, which provide permanent gem discounts and prestige points. Noble tiles visit players who amass the right combination of cards. First player to reach 15 prestige points triggers the final round, after which the highest score wins.

## Teaching Tips

- Explain that development cards act as permanent gems — this engine-building concept is the heart of the game.
- Point out that reserving a card (and taking a gold token) is a powerful tactical option, not a last resort.
- New players often ignore Nobles; remind them to build toward Noble bonuses intentionally.
- The game is ruthlessly competitive at 2 players and more interactive at 3–4 — set expectations accordingly.

## House Rules

- **Open hand**: Allow players to keep their reserved cards visible to all opponents for a more open, strategic experience.
- **Longer game**: Play to 20 prestige points for a deeper end-game experience.

## Setup Notes

- Sort development cards into three levels (I, II, III) and shuffle each separately. Reveal four cards from each level.
- Distribute gem tokens based on player count (10 gems per colour for 4 players, fewer for less).
- Place gold (wild) tokens separately — there are always 5 gold tokens regardless of player count.
- Shuffle Noble tiles and place a number equal to the number of players plus one face-up.
