## Overview

Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan) is a classic euro-style strategy game where players collect resources and use them to build settlements, cities, and roads across the island of Catan.

## Teaching Tips

- Explain the robber mechanic *before* the first 7 is rolled — it surprises new players.
- Encourage first-timers to place their starting settlements on ports relevant to their resource mix.
- Emphasise early that **longest road** and **largest army** are worth 2 VP each — beginners forget them.
- A typical teaching game runs 90 min; set expectations up front.

## House Rules

- **Friendly robber**: When playing with new players, the robber cannot be placed on a player who has fewer than 3 VP during the first 3 rounds. Makes the opening less punishing.
- **No cards-to-7 discard on the first roll**: First-time players keep their cards even on the opening 7.

## Setup Notes

- Use the beginner map for first games (printed on the back of the board).
- Place the number tokens in alphabetical order (A → R) as shown in the rulebook for a balanced distribution.
- 5–6 player expansion changes setup significantly — see expansion rules.
