## Overview

Sky Team is a cooperative two-player dice game where players take on the roles of a pilot and co-pilot working together to land planes at airports around the world. Communication is key — players cannot show or discuss the values of their dice, only the placement decisions they make together.

## GAME SETUP

### Preparing the Control Panel

1. **Remove All Advanced Modules**  
   When opening the box for the first time, discard all Control Panel parts marked with the advanced module icon. These are for later games.

2. **Assemble the Plane Components**
   - Stick the airplane sticker onto the **Airplane Axis disc** and place it in its designated space.
   - Apply the 9 double-sided stickers to the marked areas inside and on the back of the Control Panel.
   - Insert the 10 **Switches** onto the green indicator lights on the panel.

3. **Set the Control Panel**
   - Place the Control Panel between the two players, ideally sitting side by side.
   - Rotate the Airplane Axis so its arrow points to the black triangle.
   - Ensure all switches are covering their respective green lights.

4. **Set Gauges and Trackers**
   - On the **Speed Gauge**, place:
     - The **blue Aerodynamics marker** between 4 and 5.
     - The **orange Aerodynamics marker** between 8 and 9.
   - On the **Brake track**, position the red **Brake marker** just left of the &#8220;2&#8221;.

5. **Assign Roles and Dice**
   - The player on the **blue side** becomes the **Pilot** (receives 4 blue dice).
   - The player on the **orange side** becomes the **Co-Pilot** (receives 4 orange dice).

6. **Insert Tracks**
   - Slide the **Altitude Track** (green/yellow side up) into the top-right slot until “6000” is visible in the display window.
   - Insert the **YUL Montréal-Trudeau Approach Track** into the top-left slot until the correct symbol appears in its window.

7. **Place Tokens**
   - Add **Reroll tokens** to each reroll icon on the Altitude Track.
   - Place **Airplane tokens** on each space of the Approach Track that shows a Traffic icon.
   - Create a **Coffee token** reserve off the board.
   - Each player receives a **player screen** with gameplay reminders inside.

## GAMEPLAY STRUCTURE

Sky Team is played over **7 rounds**, each representing 1,000 feet of descent. Each round consists of 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Briefing and Dice Roll

- You may discuss your **strategy** freely (e.g., “We need to clear the second plane,” or “We should try to advance 1 space.”).
- **You may not discuss your dice or numbers**. No hints, no indirect clues.
- After planning, each player rolls all 4 of their dice **behind their screen**.
- From this point until the end of the round, **no talking is allowed**, unless correcting a rules mistake.

### Phase 2: Dice Placement

Take turns placing one die at a time onto the Control Panel, following these rules:

- **Color Restrictions**:
  - The **Pilot** may only use **blue** spaces.
  - The **Co-Pilot** may only use **orange** spaces.
  - Some spaces are dual-colored and may be used by either player.

- **Number Restrictions**:
  - Many spaces only accept certain die values. You must respect these limits.
  - For example, the Flaps&#8217; first slot only accepts dice showing 1 or 2.

- **Mandatory Actions**:
  - Each round, both players **must** place:
    - One die in the **Axis** section.
    - One die in the **Engines** section.
  - Failing to do so results in **instant loss**.

### Phase 3: End of Round

- Once all 8 dice are placed, speech resumes.
- The plane **descends by 1,000 feet**—advance the Altitude Track one space.
- Return all dice to the players.
- If the **Airport symbol** appears in the **Position window** and the **Airplane symbol** appears in the **Altitude window**, proceed to the final landing round.
- Otherwise, begin a new round.


## KEY ACTION AREAS

### AXIS (Mandatory)

Controls the plane&#8217;s horizontal roll. After both Axis dice are placed:

- If values are equal, the plane remains level.
- If values differ, rotate the Airplane Axis toward the higher die’s player, by the difference in values.
- If the axis arrow ever reaches or passes the red danger zone, the plane spins out of control—you **lose**.

**Endgame Requirement**: The axis must be perfectly horizontal at the end of the final round.


### ENGINES (Mandatory)

Determines forward motion. After both Engine dice are placed:

- Add their values for total speed.
- Compare to the blue and orange Aerodynamics markers on the Speed Gauge:
  - If less than the blue marker: Don’t move.
  - Between both markers: Advance the Approach Track 1 space.
  - Greater than the orange marker: Advance the Approach Track 2 spaces.

**Hazards**:

- **Collision**: Advancing into a space with an Airplane token = **lose**.
- **Overshoot**: Advancing past the airport = **lose**.

**Final Round Rule**: Instead of comparing speed to the Aerodynamics markers, compare it to the Brake marker. If your speed exceeds your brakes—you crash!


### RADIO

Clears air traffic by removing Airplane tokens:

- The Pilot has 1 space, Co-Pilot has 2.
- The die’s value = how many spaces ahead to remove a plane from, starting from the Current Position.
- If no token is in that space, the action has no effect.


### LANDING GEAR

Deploy in any order, using valid die values.

- Flip the associated Switch to green.
- Move the **blue Aerodynamics marker** forward one space.
- Re-activating an already deployed gear has no effect.

**Endgame Requirement**: All Landing Gear switches must be green.


### FLAPS

Deploy in strict numerical order: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.

- Use valid dice values to activate the next Flaps slot.
- Flip the Switch to green.
- Advance the **orange Aerodynamics marker** forward one space.

**Endgame Requirement**: All Flaps switches must be green.


### BRAKES

Used only in the **final round**.

- Deploy in order: 2 → 4 → 6.
- Each new brake increases the red Brake marker by one space.
- You don&#8217;t need to deploy all brakes, but your final speed must be **less** than the Brake marker.


### CONCENTRATION

Place any die in a free Concentration space to gain a **Coffee token**.

- Max 3 Coffee tokens on the board at any time.
- Use Coffee tokens at any time during dice placement to modify a die by ±1 (not beyond 1–6).
- Any player may spend them, even if they didn’t generate them.


## REROLL TOKENS

- If a Reroll token appears in the Altitude space, it becomes available for use that round.
- Spend it to allow **both players** to reroll **any number** of their dice once.


## WINNING THE GAME

You win *Sky Team* at the end of the final round **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. No Airplane tokens remain on the Approach Track.
2. All Flaps and Landing Gear switches show green.
3. The Axis is level (arrow pointing straight up).
4. Your final Speed is **less than** your Brakes.


## LOSING THE GAME

You immediately lose the game if:

- The Axis arrow reaches the spin zone.
- You collide with a plane.
- You overshoot the airport.
- You descend to 0 altitude without reaching the airport.
- You fail to place required dice on the Axis or Engines.


## STRATEGY &amp; TIPS

- **Use the Briefing Wisely**: Before dice rolls, discuss your priorities. Plan how many spaces you want to advance and where the biggest risks are.
- **Body Language through Dice**: After rolling, you cannot speak—but your dice placements communicate intentions. Consider how your partner will interpret your move.
- **Don’t Delay the Axis**: Axis dice are mandatory. Saving them for last is risky—place one early if possible.
- **Coffee Wisely**: Don’t waste useful dice—turn them into Coffee tokens when needed. They can be game-saving modifiers.
- **Timing Matters**: Flaps and Landing Gear affect your Aerodynamics, changing how far you move each turn. Use them only when the timing is right.
- **Read the Approach**: Keep an eye on air traffic and prepare to clear your path in time using Radio dice.
- **Final Round Focus**: Prioritize brakes, minimize speed, and align all conditions for a smooth landing.
