## Overview

Jungle Speed is a lightning-fast reflex card game. Each player has a face-down deck. Players simultaneously flip cards onto their own piles. When two players' top cards share the same symbol, those two players race to grab the wooden totem in the centre of the table. The loser takes both piles. Special cards trigger wild rounds where everyone grabs at once. First player to empty their deck wins.

## Teaching Tips

- Before the first game, lay out all the cards and let players study the tricky symbol pairs that look similar but aren't — this avoids false grabs and rule disputes.
- Emphasise that only the *same* symbol triggers a duel, not similar-looking ones (e.g. the sun vs. the flower).
- False grabs (grabbing the totem when you shouldn′t) mean you take everyone′s discards — teach this penalty upfront.
- The arrow, multi-colour, and other special cards each have distinct effects; spend a minute reading them before starting.

## House Rules

- **No-special-cards variant**: Remove all special cards for a cleaner, beginner-friendly experience.
- **Gentle totem**: Place a soft object instead of the wooden totem for younger players.

## Setup Notes

- Shuffle all cards into one deck and deal them face-down as evenly as possible to all players.
- Place the wooden totem in the centre of the table within reach of all players.
- Players hold their decks face-down and flip one card at a time to their personal face-up pile.
- The game ends when one player exhausts their entire deck.
