## Overview

Bad Bones is a fast-playing competitive tower-defense dice game. Skeletons are advancing on your village; roll dice to place traps or kill them before they destroy your buildings. Players can also redirect skeletons toward opponents' boards. Last player with a standing village wins.

## Teaching Tips

- Show the skeleton movement order before the first round — it's clockwise around the board, which often surprises players.
- Explain the redirecting mechanic early: sending skeletons to opponents is a core strategy, not a mean optional tactic.
- The trap types have different trigger conditions — take a moment to explain each type so players don't waste dice.
- Rounds move fast; keep energy high and don't over-explain. The rules click after one round.

## House Rules

- **Cooperative mode**: Play all skeletons cooperatively against the board — last building standing wins collectively.
- **No redirect for first game**: Disable sending skeletons to opponents to keep the first game simpler and focused on defence.

## Setup Notes

- Each player gets an identical village board with 8 buildings and a set of trap tiles.
- At the start of each round, draw and reveal dungeon cards to determine how many skeletons appear and from which direction.
- Skeletons added to the board move each round until they hit a trap or destroy a building.
