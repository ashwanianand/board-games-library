## Overview

The Resistance: Avalon is a social deduction game of hidden roles set in Arthurian legend. Players are either loyal Servants of Arthur or agents of the Evil Mordred. Over five missions, teams of players vote to go on quests — but evil players hidden among the team can secretly fail a mission. Good wins by passing three missions; Evil wins by failing three or correctly assassinating Merlin at the end.

## Teaching Tips

- Explain the Merlin mechanic immediately: the Good team's win is voided if Merlin is assassinated correctly at game end — this adds a meta-game of concealing who Merlin is.
- The team proposal and voting phase is where most of the deduction happens — encourage players to pay attention to who approves and rejects proposed teams.
- Evil players know each other (except Mordred) — they must balance failing missions against not revealing themselves.
- 5-player games are tight and fast; 8–10 player games are chaotic and social — adjust expectations.

## House Rules

- **No special roles**: For a first game, play without Merlin/Assassin to focus on the core team-building deduction.
- **Lady of the Lake**: Enable the Lady of the Lake token (included) to give an information track across quests — recommended once the base mechanics are familiar.

## Setup Notes

- Deal roles secretly. Only Evil players open their eyes at the start to see who else is evil (Mordred keeps eyes closed during this phase).
- Merlin opens eyes during a separate phase to see the Evil players — Evil players do not know who Merlin is.
- Mission sizes (team sizes and fail requirements) are listed on the reference card by player count.
- After five missions or when one side reaches three wins, the game ends.
