## Overview

Everdell is a worker placement and card-drafting game set in a charming woodland world. Players build a city of up to 15 cards — a mix of Critters and Constructions — using resources gathered across the Ever Tree board. The game spans three seasons of increasing worker count and action options.

## Setup Notes

- Lay out the Ever Tree board and populate the Meadow with 8 face-up cards.
- Each player starts with 2 workers (gains more each season up to 6 in Autumn).
- The Garland Awards (round objectives) and Events (bonus objectives) are optional for a first game.
- 3-canopy tower model is purely decorative but dramatic — assemble before play.
