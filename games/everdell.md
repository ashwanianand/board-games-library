## Overview

Everdell is a worker placement and card-drafting game set in a charming woodland world. Players build a city of up to 15 cards — a mix of Critters and Constructions — using resources gathered across the Ever Tree board. The game spans three seasons of increasing worker count and action options.

## Teaching Tips

- The card synergies are the heart of the game — walk through a few examples (e.g. Husband + Wife, Bard + other cards) before starting so players understand the engine.
- Season transitions confuse new players: explain that workers are *recalled*, not all returned at once, and that you gain workers/bonuses each season.
- Point out that every Construction can potentially be occupied for free by a matching Critter — this is often missed.
- The Meadow (eight shared cards) is a draft area, not a shop — refreshing it is a player action.

## House Rules

- **Simplified first game**: Remove some of the event cards to reduce the number of special rules players need to track.
- **Open hand variant**: For teaching purposes, allow players to show hands the first game to discuss strategies.

## Setup Notes

- Lay out the Ever Tree board and populate the Meadow with 8 face-up cards.
- Each player starts with 2 workers (gains more each season up to 6 in Autumn).
- The Garland Awards (round objectives) and Events (bonus objectives) are optional for a first game.
- 3-canopy tower model is purely decorative but dramatic — assemble before play.
