## Overview

Love Letter is a micro card game of risk and deduction. The 21-card deck represents members of the royal court. Players hold one card at a time and draw one card on their turn, then immediately play one. Each card has a unique power — guards guess opponents′ hands, priests peek, barons compare, and the Princess wins or loses everything. The player holding the highest card at the end of a round, or the last player standing, wins a token of affection. First to collect enough tokens wins.

## Teaching Tips

- The entire rules fit on a single card — teach by playing rather than explaining at length.
- The Guard (card 1) is the most powerful card and the most nuanced to use well — spend a moment explaining when and how to target opponents.
- Emphasise that losing is fast: rounds last only a minute or two, so elimination doesn′t sting.
- With 2 players, three cards are removed from the game face-down — this deduction element adds significant tactical depth.

## House Rules

- **Open discard**: Keep all played cards visible to all players (standard in most editions) — important for deduction.
- **Extended game**: Play to higher token counts for a longer session with more strategic depth across rounds.

## Setup Notes

- Remove one card face-down from the deck (and three more face-up when playing with 2 players).
- Deal one card face-down to each player. The remaining cards form the draw pile.
- On your turn: draw one card, then play one of the two cards in your hand, applying its effect.
- A round ends when the draw pile is exhausted or all but one player are eliminated.
- The winner of each round takes one token of affection.
