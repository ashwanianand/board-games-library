## Overview

Codenames is a team word-association game. Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 codename cards laid out in a grid. Each turn a spymaster gives a one-word clue and a number, hinting at multiple cards belonging to their team. Their team tries to guess the right cards while avoiding the opposing team's agents and the deadly Assassin. First team to identify all their agents wins — but touch the Assassin and you lose immediately.

## Setup Notes

- Lay out 25 random codename cards in a 5×5 grid.
- Spymasters share the key card (placed in the stand) — it shows which codenames belong to Red, Blue, Bystanders, or the Assassin.
- The team whose colour appears on the edges of the key card goes first and has 9 agents; the other team has 8.
- When a card is correctly identified, place the matching colour token on it; bystanders get a neutral token.


## Tips
- Touching a card counts as selecting the card.
- Red spymaster should place the blue colour tokens and blue spymaster should place red colour tokens to ensure that the correct colour is only revealed when the team has made sure decisions.
