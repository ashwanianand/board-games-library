## Overview

Codenames is a team word-association game. Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 codename cards laid out in a grid. Each turn a spymaster gives a one-word clue and a number, hinting at multiple cards belonging to their team. Their team tries to guess the right cards while avoiding the opposing team's agents and the deadly Assassin. First team to identify all their agents wins — but touch the Assassin and you lose immediately.

## Teaching Tips

- Explain the Assassin card before anything else — it keeps guessers cautious and makes the game interesting.
- Spymasters must stay poker-faced; emphasise that no gestures, sighs, or reactions are allowed once a clue is given.
- Encourage new spymasters to link at least two cards per clue — single-word clues for one card waste turns.
- The key card (known only to spymasters) determines which colour starts; the starting team has one more card to find.

## House Rules

- **Unlimited guesses on a clue**: Allow teams to keep guessing beyond the number given, at the risk of hitting wrong cards.
- **Two spymasters per team**: In large groups, two people collaborate on each clue — keeps everyone engaged.

## Setup Notes

- Lay out 25 random codename cards in a 5×5 grid.
- Spymasters share the key card (placed in the stand) — it shows which codenames belong to Red, Blue, Bystanders, or the Assassin.
- The team whose colour appears on the edges of the key card goes first and has 9 agents; the other team has 8.
- When a card is correctly identified, place the matching colour token on it; bystanders get a neutral token.
