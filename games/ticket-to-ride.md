## Overview

Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure game where players collect cards of various types of train cars and use them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America (or whichever map you own).

## Teaching Tips

- New players often hoard cards and forget to claim routes — remind them that unfinished destination tickets **lose** points.
- The "secret tickets" mechanic creates good tension: don't reveal your routes until end scoring.
- Explain blocking early: experienced players will cut off routes; warn newcomers so they don't feel blindsided.
- Good gateway game — most people pick up rules within one round.

## House Rules

- **Open tickets**: For a more collaborative/relaxed game, play the first game with destination tickets face-up so everyone can help spot conflicts.
- **Extra time variant**: Add 5 minutes to the timer for players who are new; they may draw destination tickets once for free at any point.

## Setup Notes

- Shuffle destination tickets thoroughly; each player draws 3 and keeps at least 2.
- The 1-car routes are only playable in 3–5 player games (marked in the rules).
- Europe map adds tunnels and ferries — adds approximately 20% to teaching time.
