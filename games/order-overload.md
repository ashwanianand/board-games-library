## Overview

Order Overload is a fast-paced party game in which players race to fulfil increasingly complex orders before their opponents. Cards pile up quickly and players must keep track of what′s been requested, creating a frantic and often hilarious scramble. The player who completes the most orders correctly across rounds wins.

## Teaching Tips

- Run a short practice round with simple orders before playing competitively — new players need to get a feel for the pace.
- Emphasise that speed matters, but wrong answers cost points — encourage players to double-check before submitting.
- Keep the table clear of clutter; cards move around quickly and losing pieces slows the game.

## House Rules

- **Relaxed timer**: Extend each round′s time limit for groups that prefer a more casual experience.
- **Team mode**: Pair players into teams and allow them to consult each other before answering.

## Setup Notes

- Shuffle the order deck and deal the starting hand as specified in the rulebook.
- Place the scoring track in the centre of the table where all players can see it.
- Designate a dealer for the round who will reveal cards at the appropriate pace.
- Review the penalty rules for incorrect orders before the first round.
