## Overview

Cascadia is a tile-drafting and wildlife-placement game set in the Pacific Northwest. Players build a personal nature landscape by placing habitat tiles and pairing them with wildlife tokens. Each wildlife type (hawks, elk, salmon, foxes, bears) scores differently based on the scoring cards chosen at game start.

## Game Setup

| Players | Terrain Tiles | Left in Box | Animals Each |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2 | 43 | 42 | 10 |
| 3 | 63 | 22 | 15 |
| 4 | 83 | 2 | 20 |

## Player Turn

- If all four animals are the same, replace them all.
- If three animals are the same, optionally replace them, once per turn.
- Spend as many nature tokens as you wish.
- Spend a nature token to replace any number of animals.
- Spend a nature token to take any terrain with any animal.
- Otherwise, take a set of terrain - animal.
- Place the terrain anywhere in your environment.
- Place the animal on any matching terrain.
- Gain a nature token for placing an animal on a single-animal tile.
