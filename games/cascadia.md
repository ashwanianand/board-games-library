## Overview

Cascadia is a tile-drafting and wildlife-placement game set in the Pacific Northwest. Players build a personal nature landscape by placing habitat tiles and pairing them with wildlife tokens. Each wildlife type (hawks, elk, salmon, foxes, bears) scores differently based on the scoring cards chosen at game start.

## Teaching Tips

- Show the five wildlife scoring cards at setup so players know which patterns they're aiming for early.
- Remind players that each tile has two habitat types and a limited set of accepted wildlife symbols — misplacing wildlife is a common mistake.
- The nature token (pine cone) is powerful: explain it early so beginners don't forget to use it.
- Solo mode uses the same rules with a target score — great for practice runs.

## House Rules

- **Family scoring cards**: Use the "A" scoring cards (simpler patterns) for first games with younger players.
- **Overfill rule**: If you can't legally place a wildlife token, it's discarded — some groups house-rule that it's returned to the supply instead.

## Setup Notes

- Randomly select one scoring card per wildlife type before the game begins.
- Lay out the starting habitat tile (starter tile) in front of each player.
- Place 3 visible tile-wildlife pairs in the central display; refill after each pick.
- The bag holds all habitat tiles; shake well before drawing.
