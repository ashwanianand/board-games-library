## Overview

Sky Team is a cooperative two-player dice game where players take on the roles of a pilot and co-pilot working together to land planes at airports around the world. Communication is key — players cannot show or discuss the values of their dice, only the placement decisions they make together.

## Teaching Tips

- Stress the no-communication rule firmly before starting: players cannot reveal their dice values, only where they're placing a die and why in broad terms.
- Start on the easiest airport (Montreal) for the first game — the difficulty ramps up steeply.
- Walk through each axis section together before the first round so both players understand what each slot does.
- The "brake" track is easy to neglect — remind both players to watch it throughout the flight.

## House Rules

- **Training mode**: Allow open communication for the very first game so players learn the mechanics without the extra pressure.
- **Relaxed descent**: For newer players, ignore the optional aerobatic cards until the base game is comfortable.

## Setup Notes

- Each airport card specifies its own setup adjustments (extra tokens, mandatory dice, approach angle) — read it carefully before setting up.
- The approach track goes from 9 down to 0; landing happens at 0 with the plane correctly configured.
- Expansion airports can be mixed in once the base airports are mastered.
