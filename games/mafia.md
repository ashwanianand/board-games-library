## Overview

Mafia is a classic social deduction party game. One group of players (the Mafia) secretly knows each other's identities, while the larger group of Townspeople tries to identify and eliminate them by majority vote. Each night the Mafia eliminates a Townsperson; each day the town deliberates and votes to eliminate a suspect. The game ends when all Mafia are eliminated or the Mafia equals or outnumbers the Town.

## Teaching Tips

- A moderator (who doesn't play) makes the game run smoothly — designate one before starting.
- Teach new players that lying is not just allowed, it's expected — set that culture from the start.
- Remind the town to reason out loud during the day phase; silent games are unenjoyable.
- Balance matters: roughly 1 Mafia per 4–5 players is a common ratio (e.g. 3 Mafia for 12–15 players).

## House Rules

- **Doctor role**: One Townsperson can save one player each night; if the saved player is targeted by the Mafia, they survive.
- **Detective role**: One Townsperson secretly learns each night whether one chosen player is Mafia or Town.
- **No elimination on Day 1**: Some groups skip the first day vote to give players time to gather information.

## Setup Notes

- Shuffle role cards (Mafia + Townspeople) face-down and deal one to each player.
- Players look at their cards secretly, then place them face-down.
- The moderator runs night rounds (everyone closes eyes, Mafia opens eyes and points to a target).
- Keep track of eliminated players' roles — revealing them after elimination adds information to the game.
