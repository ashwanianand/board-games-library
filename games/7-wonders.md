## Overview

7 Wonders is a card-drafting civilisation game played over three Ages. Each player leads an ancient city and builds it by drafting cards representing structures, guilds, and wonders. Cards generate resources, victory points, science symbols, military strength, and commerce. All players act simultaneously — pick a card, pass the hand, repeat. The civilisation with the most victory points after three Ages wins.

## Teaching Tips

- The simultaneous card selection makes the game fast regardless of player count — highlight this to players nervous about downtime.
- Science scoring (set collection that scales quadratically) is opaque at first — walk through an example before the game.
- Military is blind until the end of each Age — players often neglect shields and are surprised by the penalties.
- Wonders can be powerful end-game scoring engines; explain that burying a card under a wonder stage is always an option.

## House Rules

- **No military**: Remove the red cards and military scoring for a more purely economic and scientific experience — good for introducing new players.
- **Score reveal during play**: Optionally track points openly to help new players understand which strategies are working.

## Setup Notes

- Each player takes a Wonder board (random or draft) and its corresponding starting resource.
- Shuffle each Age deck separately; deal 7 cards per player from Age I to start.
- On each turn: choose one card, then simultaneously reveal. Play it, bury it for a wonder stage, or discard for 3 coins.
- Pass hands clockwise in Ages I and III, counter-clockwise in Age II.
- After Age III, resolve final military and count all victory points.
