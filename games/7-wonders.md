## Overview

7 Wonders is a card-drafting civilisation game played over three Ages. Each player leads an ancient city and builds it by drafting cards representing structures, guilds, and wonders. Cards generate resources, victory points, science symbols, military strength, and commerce. All players act simultaneously — pick a card, pass the hand, repeat. The civilisation with the most victory points after three Ages wins.

## Start
- Remove cards depending on #players.
- Use only (#players + 2) Guilds. Random and secret.
- Randomly assign wonders and side. (Side A if learning)
- $3

## Structure 
3 Ages, at the start of which receive 7 cards, then
followed by 6 turns.

## Turn 
1. Choose 1 card.
2. Action (simultaneous), pick 1 of these:
    #### a. Build card
        - Top left is cost. If own prerequisite building, build for free.
        - Lower right is free building after this one.
        - To build, must either produce required resources or buy from neighbours.
        - If buying, $2 per resource. May not use money earned in current round. Neighbour may not refuse, also does not lose resource. Resources only bought for 1 turn.
        - No duplicates
        - Brown & grey cards tucked under upper left of board.
    #### b. Build 1 stage of wonder
        - Pay cost. Tuck card face-down under current stage.
    #### c. Discard card for $3
3. Pass cards. Clockwise in Ages I & III, Anticlockwise in Age II.

## End of Age
- Compare military strength with neighbours. Get -1VP token if weaker, +1/3/5VP token for Age I/II/III if stronger, none if tied.

## End
- 1VP per $3
- VP’s for wonders and buildings
- Science symbols: for each type – (#symbols)2 VP, for each set of 3 different symbols – 7VP.
- Tiebreaker is money.

## Others
