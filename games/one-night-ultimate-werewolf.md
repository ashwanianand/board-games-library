## Overview

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast social deduction game where everyone gets a secret role. During the night phase (run via a free app or a moderator), roles take actions that may swap cards or reveal information. After the night phase, players debate for a few minutes and then everyone simultaneously votes to eliminate one player. The Villagers win if a Werewolf is eliminated; the Werewolves win if a Villager is.

## Teaching Tips

- Use the free **Bezier Games app** as the moderator — it narrates the night phase clearly and removes the need for a human moderator.
- Emphasise that your card may have been **swapped during the night** — you could be a different role than you started with.
- Keep the day discussion to a strict time limit (3–5 minutes) to maintain energy.
- Start with just a few roles (Werewolves, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker) before adding more complex ones.

## House Rules

- **Extended discussion**: Allow 7–8 minutes for larger groups or first-time players.
- **Reveal on elimination**: After the vote, reveal the eliminated player's current card to immediately see if the village wins or loses — some groups enjoy the dramatic reveal.

## Setup Notes

- Place 3 more role cards than there are players in the centre of the table (these are hidden roles that may come into play via certain role abilities).
- Each player looks at their role secretly before closing eyes for the night phase.
- The night phase has each role wake up in a set order — the app or moderator script handles this.
